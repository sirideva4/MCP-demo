# 🧠 MCP-Demo — A Minimal Message Communication Protocol over HTTP

This project is a simple but powerful **Message Communication Protocol (MCP)** demo using Python. It showcases how a **client** can communicate with a **server** over **HTTP** using clean, safe, and industry-friendly techniques.

## 🧩 What is MCP (Message Communication Protocol)?

**MCP** is a pattern or method that defines how two programs (usually a client and a server) exchange **messages** — such as data, commands, or requests — to perform tasks.

In simple terms:

> 🗣️ Client: “Hey server, here’s a math expression like `5+7`. What’s the result?”  
> 🤖 Server: “Here you go, the answer is `12`.”

### MCP in the real world:

- Microservices talk via MCPs (HTTP, gRPC, message queues)
- Multiplayer games use MCP to sync state between players and server
- Any automation tool (CLI ↔ API) uses some form of MCP under the hood

This demo focuses on using **HTTP and JSON** as the message format — one of the most common and industry-standard protocols.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

✅ Implements a **Python server (`server.py`)** using FastAPI  
✅ Implements a **Python client (`client.py`)** that sends messages (math expressions)  
✅ Demonstrates how **MCP** works using HTTP requests and JSON responses  
✅ Safely evaluates expressions like `5+7`, `8/2`, `2**4`  
✅ Shows error handling for invalid math or division by zero
